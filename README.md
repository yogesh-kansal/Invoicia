Note(s):- 1) Design and specification are completely dependent on you but pages must have standard fields there
            and you may add extra fields as well.
          2) More information related to each and every page will be shared with you once it is assigned to you. 
          3) You have to strictly use react.js conventions while implementing features.
          4) You can test them based on dummy data as well, no need to worry about backend and other things)`.
